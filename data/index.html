        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          According to PEW Research, 96% of adults between 18-29 occasionally
          consult reviews before making a purchase. But does this mean that
          higher ratings result in more product sales? Specifically, what do
          higher ratings indicate for video game sales? Maybe higher ratings
          lead to more game sales. But could some more obscure games with a
          dedicated group of followers receive higher ratings than popular games
          with significant sales volume? I am also curious whether there has
          been an increase in the production of games in recent years and, if
          so, what effect this increase has on the quality of games based on
          review scores. Is it possible that an increase in the number of games
          results in review scores decreasing with the oversaturation of video
          game releases?
        </p>
        <p>
          In this project, I plan to use Metacritic’s user and critic review
          scores to see if there is a correlation between the scores of a game
          and its overall sales. I will be joining the review data with sales
          data obtained from VGChartz.
        </p>

      <section id="data">
        <h2>2. Data</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Review Scores</h3>
        <p>
          I collected data from Metacritic, which contained user (user score)
          and critic (meta score) review scores for each game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Metacritic’s data was found on 186 different web pages. I wrote a web
          crawling script to collect all data across these 186 pages. I
          collected the game title, summary, platform, user score, meta score,
          and release date for 18,526 games. Some of the results were the same
          game that was released on different platforms, which is essential to
          consider when I begin merging the data. I created a data frame which
          is contained in the Metacritic.csv file in the project folder. The web
          crawling script that I wrote is contained in the metacritic.R file in
          the project folder.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Video Game Sales</h3>
        <p>
          The website VGChartz provides sales data about the number of units of
          each game/platform combination sold. The information was contained in
          1,249 web pages. Due to the extensive nature of the data, I decided to
          break the web crawling results into six different CSV files
          (VGChartz_0 – 5.csv), all contained in the project folder. The web
          crawling script is contained in the vgchartz.R file in the project
          folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          I collected the game, platform, release date, publisher, and sales
          data from PAL, Japan, and North America as well as total game sales
          for 62,398 games. Like the Metacritic data, some of these games were
          released on multiple platforms, which count as a unique observation in
          the data.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Combining Reviews and Sales</h3>
        <p>
          Since both data sets included the same game title multiple times based
          on the platform, I had to merge based on both the game title and
          platform. Both data sets are also vastly different in the number of
          observations. I decided to create two separate data sets in merging.
          One data set is the intersection of the data and only contains data
          that appears in both data sets. The other data set, called the union,
          contains all rows from both data sets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, I imported both data frames into the cleaning_vgs.R file in the
          project folder for further cleaning. Since the differentiator between
          both data frames is their number of rows and most of my cleaning was
          regarding the columns, I created a function to iterate over both data
          sets to clean them. This cleaning included trimming the white space on
          the summary and publisher, turning the sales data into numeric, and
          adding the platform, publisher, and title as factors.
